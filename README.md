# Linear-Regression-Project-House-Price-Prediction

The House Price Prediction project is designed to apply linear regression techniques to predict the selling prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. This project involves the collection, analysis, and processing of real-world housing data, followed by the implementation of a linear regression model to identify relationships between the features and the target variable (house price).

Key Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a dataset containing features like square footage, neighborhood, number of rooms, age of the house, and more. Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the underlying patterns in the data. Visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and other techniques.

Model Building: Implement a linear regression model using libraries such as scikit-learn in Python. Fit the model to the training data to learn the coefficients that represent the relationship between the features and house prices.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and cross-validation. Analyze the model's accuracy and adjust it if necessary by selecting features, regularization, or fine-tuning hyperparameters.

Prediction and Interpretation: Use the trained model to predict house prices on unseen data. Interpret the coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted price, providing insights into which factors are most influential.

Outcome: The project provides a working model capable of predicting house prices with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, it offers insights into the factors that most significantly affect house prices, helping stakeholders make informed decisions regarding real estate investments.

Objective:

The objective of this Linear Regression project is to develop a predictive model for house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors. By applying Linear Regression techniques, the project aims to identify the key determinants of house prices and accurately predict the market value of a property. The final model will be evaluated for its accuracy and reliability, providing valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
